# CV
My CV, forked from [resume](https://github.com/junhaodong/resume) which was based on the fantastic [Awesome CV](https://github.com/posquit0/Awesome-CV).

Comes with a few small alterations to the original:
* Locations and dates aren't italicised.
* Qualifications aren't wholly capitalised by default.
* Altered the skills section to be more in line with a developer's skillset.
